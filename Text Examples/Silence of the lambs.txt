Behavioral Science, the FBI section that deals with serial murder, is on the bottom
floor of the Academy building at Quantico, half-buried in the earth. Clarice Starling
reached it flushed after a fast walk from Hogan's Alley on the firing range. She had grass
in her hair and grass stains on her FBI Academy windbreaker from diving to the ground
under fire in an arrest problem on the range.No one was in the outer office, so she fluffed briefly by her reflection in the glass
doors. She knew she could look all right without primping. Her hands smelled of
gunsmoke, but there was no time to wash--- Section Chief Crawford's summons had said
now.
