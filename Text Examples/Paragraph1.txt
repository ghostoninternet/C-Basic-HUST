THERE ARE SOME KINDS OF WORK THAT YOU CAN'T DO WELL WITHOUT THINKING DIFFERENTLY FROM YOUR PEERS. TO BE A SUCCESSFUL SCIENTIST, FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO BE CORRECT. YOUR IDEAS HAVE TO BE BOTH CORRECT AND NOVEL. YOU CAN'T PUBLISH PAPERS SAYING THINGS OTHER PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW. YOU NEED TO SAY THINGS NO ONE ELSE HAS REALIZED YET.

THE SAME IS TRUE FOR INVESTORS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR A PUBLIC MARKET INVESTOR TO PREDICT CORRECTLY HOW A COMPANY WILL DO. IF A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE MAKE THE SAME PREDICTION, THE STOCK PRICE WILL ALREADY REFLECT IT, AND THERE'S NO ROOM TO MAKE MONEY. THE ONLY VALUABLE INSIGHTS ARE THE ONES MOST OTHER INVESTORS DON'T SHARE.

YOU SEE THIS PATTERN WITH STARTUP FOUNDERS TOO. YOU DON'T WANT TO START A STARTUP TO DO SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE AGREES IS A GOOD IDEA, OR THERE WILL ALREADY BE OTHER COMPANIES DOING IT. YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS TO MOST OTHER PEOPLE LIKE A BAD IDEA, BUT THAT YOU KNOW ISN'T — LIKE WRITING SOFTWARE FOR A TINY COMPUTER USED BY A FEW THOUSAND HOBBYISTS, OR STARTING A SITE TO LET PEOPLE RENT AIRBEDS ON STRANGERS' FLOORS.

DITTO FOR ESSAYISTS. AN ESSAY THAT TOLD PEOPLE THINGS THEY ALREADY KNEW WOULD BE BORING. YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING NEW.

BUT THIS PATTERN ISN'T UNIVERSAL. IN FACT, IT DOESN'T HOLD FOR MOST KINDS OF WORK. IN MOST KINDS OF WORK — TO BE AN ADMINISTRATOR, FOR EXAMPLE — ALL YOU NEED IS THE FIRST HALF. ALL YOU NEED IS TO BE RIGHT. IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL THAT EVERYONE ELSE BE WRONG.

THERE'S ROOM FOR A LITTLE NOVELTY IN MOST KINDS OF WORK, BUT IN PRACTICE THERE'S A FAIRLY SHARP DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE KINDS OF WORK WHERE IT'S ESSENTIAL TO BE INDEPENDENT-MINDED, AND THE KINDS WHERE IT'S NOT.

I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THIS DISTINCTION WHEN I WAS A KID, BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE DECIDING WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU WANT TO DO. DO YOU WANT TO DO THE KIND OF WORK WHERE YOU CAN ONLY WIN BY THINKING DIFFERENTLY FROM EVERYONE ELSE? I SUSPECT MOST PEOPLE'S UNCONSCIOUS MIND WILL ANSWER THAT QUESTION BEFORE THEIR CONSCIOUS MIND HAS A CHANCE TO. I KNOW MINE DOES.

INDEPENDENT-MINDEDNESS SEEMS TO BE MORE A MATTER OF NATURE THAN NURTURE. WHICH MEANS IF YOU PICK THE WRONG TYPE OF WORK, YOU'RE GOING TO BE UNHAPPY. IF YOU'RE NATURALLY INDEPENDENT-MINDED, YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT FRUSTRATING TO BE A MIDDLE MANAGER. AND IF YOU'RE NATURALLY CONVENTIONAL-MINDED, YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAILING INTO A HEADWIND IF YOU TRY TO DO ORIGINAL RESEARCH.

ONE DIFFICULTY HERE, THOUGH, IS THAT PEOPLE ARE OFTEN MISTAKEN ABOUT WHERE THEY FALL ON THE SPECTRUM FROM CONVENTIONAL- TO INDEPENDENT-MINDED. CONVENTIONAL-MINDED PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO THINK OF THEMSELVES AS CONVENTIONAL-MINDED. AND IN ANY CASE, IT GENUINELY FEELS TO THEM AS IF THEY MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS ABOUT EVERYTHING. IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT THEIR BELIEFS ARE IDENTICAL TO THEIR PEERS'. AND THE INDEPENDENT-MINDED, MEANWHILE, ARE OFTEN UNAWARE HOW DIFFERENT THEIR IDEAS ARE FROM CONVENTIONAL ONES, AT LEAST TILL THEY STATE THEM PUBLICLY. [1]

BY THE TIME THEY REACH ADULTHOOD, MOST PEOPLE KNOW ROUGHLY HOW SMART THEY ARE (IN THE NARROW SENSE OF ABILITY TO SOLVE PRE-SET PROBLEMS), BECAUSE THEY'RE CONSTANTLY BEING TESTED AND RANKED ACCORDING TO IT. BUT SCHOOLS GENERALLY IGNORE INDEPENDENT-MINDEDNESS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THEY TRY TO SUPPRESS IT. SO WE DON'T GET ANYTHING LIKE THE SAME KIND OF FEEDBACK ABOUT HOW INDEPENDENT-MINDED WE ARE.

THERE MAY EVEN BE A PHENOMENON LIKE DUNNING-KRUGER AT WORK, WHERE THE MOST CONVENTIONAL-MINDED PEOPLE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THEY'RE INDEPENDENT-MINDED, WHILE THE GENUINELY INDEPENDENT-MINDED WORRY THEY MIGHT NOT BE INDEPENDENT-MINDED ENOUGH.


Can you make yourself more independent-minded? I think so. This quality may be largely inborn, but there seem to be ways to magnify it, or at least not to suppress it.

One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and make more effort to find out.

It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you're surrounded by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have. But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you'll have the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising things will encourage you to, and to think of more.

Because the independent-minded find it uncomfortable to be surrounded by conventional-minded people, they tend to self-segregate once they have a chance to. The problem with high school is that they haven't yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be an inward-looking little world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both of which magnify the forces of conformism. So high school is often a bad time for the independent-minded. But there is some advantage even here: it teaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation that makes you think "this is like high school," you know you should get out. [2]

Another place where the independent- and conventional-minded are thrown together is in successful startups. The founders and early employees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startup wouldn't be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly outnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the original spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted. This causes all kinds of problems besides the obvious one that the company starts to suck. One of the strangest is that the founders find themselves able to speak more freely with founders of other companies than with their own employees. [3]

Fortunately you don't have to spend all your time with independent-minded people. It's enough to have one or two you can talk to regularly. And once you find them, they're usually as eager to talk as you are; they need you too. Although universities no longer have the kind of monopoly they used to have on education, good universities are still an excellent way to meet independent-minded people. Most students will still be conventional-minded, but you'll at least find clumps of independent-minded ones, rather than the near zero you may have found in high school.

It also works to go in the other direction: as well as cultivating a small collection of independent-minded friends, to try to meet as many different types of people as you can. It will decrease the influence of your immediate peers if you have several other groups of peers. Plus if you're part of several different worlds, you can often import ideas from one to another.

But by different types of people, I don't mean demographically different. For this technique to work, they have to think differently. So while it's an excellent idea to go and visit other countries, you can probably find people who think differently right around the corner. When I meet someone who knows a lot about something unusual (which includes practically everyone, if you dig deep enough), I try to learn what they know that other people don't. There are almost always surprises here. It's a good way to make conversation when you meet strangers, but I don't do it to make conversation. I really want to know.

You can expand the source of influences in time as well as space, by reading history. When I read history I do it not just to learn what happened, but to try to get inside the heads of people who lived in the past. How did things look to them? This is hard to do, but worth the effort for the same reason it's worth travelling far to triangulate a point.

You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from automatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general is to cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone say something, stop and ask yourself "Is that true?" Don't say it out loud. I'm not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to you the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take upon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.

Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later turn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is not to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game should be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene. And you'll be surprised, when you start asking "Is this true?", how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If you have any imagination, you're more likely to have too many leads to follow than too few.

More generally your goal should be not to let anything into your head unexamined, and things don't always enter your head in the form of statements. Some of the most powerful influences are implicit. How do you even notice these? By standing back and watching how other people get their ideas.

When you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas spreading through groups of people like waves. The most obvious are in fashion: you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt, and then more and more, until half the people around you are wearing the same shirt. You may not care much what you wear, but there are intellectual fashions too, and you definitely don't want to participate in those. Not just because you want sovereignty over your own thoughts, but because unfashionable ideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere interesting. The best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else is looking. [4]
