When Yale University neuroscientist Nenad Sestan used a brew of nutrients, proteins, and drugs to resuscitate a pig's brain hours after its death, he discovered the line between life and death wasn't as clear as he'd once thought. 
His goal hadn't been to reanimate the brain but rather to study its wiring.
As soon as he published the sensational results in 2019, interest in his lab's activities flooded in from around the world.
"A lot of colleagues at Yale and elsewhere came knocking on our door, saying, 'We need to try this in kidney, we need to try that,'" Sestan says.
All this interest led him and his team to concoct a solution, which they dubbed OrganEx, that when pumped through the circulatory system can restore function to multiple organs in an animal that has been dead for more than an hour. "I'm a neuroscientist," Sestan laughs. "In my wildest imagination, I never thought I'd be working on a kidney, heart, or another organ. 
But the unmet needs of organ transplantation really motivated us."

"Russia's comments about suspending its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative are regrettable. This life-saving agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey, brokered in July by the United Nations, has allowed the export of more than nine million metric tons of grain and other food products to populations around the world in the midst of a devastating global food crisis," USAID Administrator Samantha Power wrote in a statement Sunday.
